#a board is generated (8 arrays of 8 empty squares)
#the pieces are generated and fill the rows of the arrays
#the players alternate moving pieces to different parts of the board/grid
#moving onto an occupied space will replace the occupier with the piece moving in
#from this point, we begin implementing rules to the valid moves which reflect the movements of chess
